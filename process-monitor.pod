=head1 NAME

process-monitor - run a child process and restart it when it exits.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<process-monitor> I<[options]> B<[--]> I<child [child_args...]>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<process-monitor> runs another program as a child process.  The child process
will be restarted when it exits, with delays to prevent continuous restarting.
Appropriate signals are passed to the child.

I<child> is a path to an executable.  I<child_args> are any number of arguments
that will be passed to the child.

I<--> is required if any of I<child_args> begins with 'I<->' due to option
processing.  It's probably better to always include I<-->.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item -D I<dirname>

=item --dir I<dirname>

Run the child process with its current directory set to I<dirname>.
B<process-monitor> itself still runs with its current directory unchanged, or
set to F</> if running as a daemon.

=item -d

=item --daemon

Go into the background before running I<child>.  This changes the handling of
SIGHUP and SIGINT - see the SIGNAL HANDLING section.

=item -C

=item --clear-env

Clear the environment before setting any variables specified by -E.

=item -E NAME=VALUE

=item --env NAME=VALUE

Pass this environment variable to the child process.  To unset a variable, omit
the '=VALUE'.

=item -e I<emailaddress>

=item --email I<emailaddress>

Send email to I<emailaddress> when restarting I<child>.  (Not implemented.)

=item -L I<name>

=item --child-log-name I<name>

Use I<name> in messages from the child process.  Defaults to the last path
component of I<child>.

=item -l I<name>

=item --log-name I<name>

Use I<name> in messages from B<process-monitor>.  This enables messages from
different B<process-monitor> processes to be distinguished in syslog.  Defaults
to the last path component of the name that was used to start
B<process-monitor>.

=item -M I<time>

=item --max-wait-time I<time>

Specify the maximum time to wait between child restarts as I<time>, in seconds.

=item -m I<time>

=item --min-wait-time I<time>

Specify the minimum time to wait between child restarts as I<time>, in seconds.
B<process-monitor> will always wait at least one second between restarts.

The wait time starts at I<time>, and doubles for each start, up to the maximum
specified with I<-M>.

=item -p I<pidfile>

=item --pid-file I<pidfile>

With the -d or --daemon flag, makes B<process-monitor> write its PID to
F<pidfile> after it goes into the background.  Without -d or --daemon,
B<process-monitor> does not write to F<pidfile>.

If I<pidfile> cannot be written to, B<process-monitor> will exit.

=item -u I<user>

=item --user I<user>

Run the child as I<user>, which can be a name or uid.  A group can be specified
by saying C<user:group>, or only a group can be specified by saying C<:group>.
Normally only the superuser will be able to set the uid and gid, although other
users will be able to set gid if they are members of that group.

=head1 SIGNAL HANDLING

=over

=item SIGTERM

SIGTERM is handled by the parent, and immediately sent to the child when it
happens.  After sending this signal, the child is not restarted again, and
B<process-monitor> exits the next time that the child exits.

=item SIGINT and SIGHUP

SIGHUP is commonly used by daemons to tell them to re-read configuration, so
when running as a daemon, we pass SIGHUP to the child and do nothing else.

When not running as a daemon, we pass SIGHUP to the child and exit when it
does.

SIGINT is handled in the same way as SIGHUP.

When running as a daemon, neither of these signals change the behaviour of
B<process-monitor> when the child exits.  If we would have restarted it before
the signal, then we will still restart it after the signal.  If we would have
exited on child exit before the signal, then we will do so after the signal.

=item SIGUSR1

SIGUSR1 tells B<process-monitor> to stop monitoring the child process.  After
this signal, the child process will not be restarted if it exits.

=item SIGUSR2

SIGUSR2 tells B<process-monitor> to begin monitoring the child process.  If the
child is still running, B<process-monitor> does nothing.  If it is not running,
it is restarted.

=item SIGCHLD

SIGCHLD is handled for child process management

=item SIGALRM

SIGALRM is used for child process restart timeouts.
